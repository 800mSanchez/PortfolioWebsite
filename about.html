                        When I was 17, I began my passion in running Track & Field. Throughout the last 7 years of running I have ran thousands of miles, experienced extreme fatigue, and have pushed my body beyond limits I had previously thought impossible. Over the span of these years, I established my identity as someone who competes to be at the top. I understand that sometimes it takes patience and constant hard work to see success. Every day is an opportunity to seek success as well. Now, I pour that same passion into the tech field. I have obtained knowledge in Javascript, React, and much more. If youâ€™re up for a run or want to know more about my experience and qualifications, please feel free to send an email my way.
